MLOps CI/CD Pipeline – Homework 2

This repository contains the implementation of Homework 2 for the SWE016 – MLOps course. It demonstrates an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, including unit tests, linting, Docker-based packaging, smoke testing of a running service, and a stop-the-line mechanism that blocks deployment when errors are detected.
